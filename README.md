# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

This project showcases a detailed analysis of road accidents over the years, utilizing data visualization techniques to uncover insights about accident severity, types, locations, and various factors contributing to accidents. The project was developed using SQL for data extraction, Excel for data cleaning and manipulation, and Tableau for visualization.

## Key Features:
- **Total Accidents & Casualties**: Overview of the total number of accidents and casualties, with year-over-year comparisons.
- **Fatalities Breakdown**: Analysis of fatal casualties based on vehicle type, weather conditions, road surface, and location.
- **Accident Types**: Differentiates between serious and slight casualties, providing insight into trends and factors contributing to each.
- **Location Heatmap**: A geographical visualization of accident hotspots, highlighting areas with the highest number of fatal accidents.
- **Vehicle & Weather Analysis**: Investigates how vehicle types and weather conditions contribute to accident rates and severities.

## Tools & Technologies Used:
- **SQL**: For data extraction and querying the raw accident data.
- **Excel**: Used for data cleaning, manipulation, and preparation before visualizing.
- **Tableau**: Data visualization tool used to create interactive dashboards and generate insights.

## Dashboard Insights:
- **Fatalities by Vehicle Type**: Bicycles and cars have the highest number of fatal casualties.
- **Weather Impact**: Rainy conditions accounted for a significant portion of accidents, with fog and snow contributing less.
- **Road Surface**: Majority of accidents occurred on dry roads, while a notable number also happened on wet surfaces.
- **Location Analysis**: Identified key areas with high fatal accident rates through a heatmap of accident locations.

## Key Findings:
- Fatalities increased by **37.95% year-over-year**.
- Serious casualties show a **11.71% YoY** increase, while slight casualties grew by **10.56% YoY**.
- Majority of accidents occurred on **single carriageways**, while dual carriageways had a lower rate.

## How to Use:
- Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or any other source of road accident data.
- Import the data into SQL for querying and data manipulation.
- Use Excel to clean and further manipulate the data if necessary.
- Load the data into Tableau and replicate the dashboard to visualize insights.

## Future Enhancements:
- **Predictive Analysis**: Use machine learning models to predict accident hotspots and trends.
- **Interactive Filters**: Allow users to filter accidents based on additional factors such as time of day or driver age.
- **Real-Time Data**: Integrate real-time data for monitoring and predicting accident trends.

## Repository Structure:
- **/SQL**: Contains SQL scripts used for querying and data extraction.
- **/Excel**: Excel sheets used for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **/Tableau**: Tableau workbook and dashboards.
- **/Data**: Raw and cleaned datasets (if permissible to share).
